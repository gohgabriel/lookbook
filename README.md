# Lookbook

Lookbook is a R library with various R functions designed to explore patterns in your datasets.

# Installation

You can install the "lookbook" package directly from GitHub using the devtools package in R:

```
# If you don't have 'devtools' installed yet:
install.packages("devtools")

# Install the 'lookbook' package
devtools::install_github("gohgabriel/lookbook")
```

## Model Explorer

Model explorer facilitates a structured approach to investigating the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables within a dataset. It systematically generates and evaluates various linear models, aiding in the discovery of significant predictors and their interactions.

### Usage

```
# Assuming 'my_data' is your dataset, with variables  
# 'outcome', 'pred1', 'pred2', ... 
result <- model_explorer(data = my_data, y_var = "outcome", x1_var = "pred1", x2_var = "pred2") 

print(result)
```

### Parameters

* data: A data frame containing the variables.
* y_var: The name of the target variable (as a string).
* x1_var, x2_var, ... (up to x5_var): The names of predictor variables (as strings).
* p_value_threshold (optional): The p-value threshold for statistical significance (default = 0.05).

### Output

The function returns a data frame with the following columns:

```
    model: The model formula.
    significant_predictors: A list of statistically significant predictors.
    p_values: A list of corresponding p-values.
```

### Example

```
library(datasets)  # Use the built-in 'mtcars' dataset

result <- model_explorer(data = mtcars, y_var = "mpg", 
                         x1_var = "cyl", x2_var = "disp", x3_var = "hp")
print(result)
```
